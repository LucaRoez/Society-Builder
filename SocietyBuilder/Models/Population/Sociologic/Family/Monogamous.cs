    //  Conditions for Monogamy:

    //  Resource Scarcity or Even Distribution: When resources are limited or spread evenly, monogamy can be advantageous.
    //  It allows both partners to invest heavily in offspring, maximizing their survival.

    //  Parental Investment Needs: High-investment offspring, like those needing prolonged care (e.g., human infants),
    //  encourage monogamy as both parents' involvement increases survival chances.
