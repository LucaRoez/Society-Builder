    //  Conditions for Solitary Structures:

    //  Resource Scarcity in Dense Territories: Solitary structures tend to arise when resources do not support group living,
    //  leading individuals to establish territories and avoid direct competition.

    //  Low Reproductive Pressure: Species with lower reproductive rates and high independence in offspring rearing, such as large felines,
    //  often adopt solitary behaviors.
