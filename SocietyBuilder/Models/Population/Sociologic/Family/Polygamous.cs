    //  Conditions for Harem Structures:

    //  Resource Control or Unequal Distribution: In environments where one male can control valuable resources (such as fertile land or livestock),
    //  a harem structure often arises.Males who monopolize resources gain reproductive advantage, drawing multiple females to their resources.

    //  Low Population Density: Polygyny is more viable when population density is lower, as males can establish territories with enough resources
    //  to support multiple females and their offspring.
