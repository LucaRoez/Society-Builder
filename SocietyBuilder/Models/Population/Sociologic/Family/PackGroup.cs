    //  Conditions for Pack Dynamics:

    //  High Resource Scarcity with Group Labor Benefits: Pack structures arise when resources require cooperative efforts to obtain
    //  (e.g., hunting large game). Groups with shared goals, mutual care, and division of labor become essential.

    //  High Predation Pressure: In environments with significant threats, cooperative defense mechanisms, where pack members protect one another,
    //  are advantageous.
